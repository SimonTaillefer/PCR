The class of robot convergence tasks has been shown to capture fundamental aspects of 
fault-tolerant computability. A set of asynchronous robots that may fail by crashing, start from unknown 
places in some given space, and have to move towards positions close to each other. In this article, we study 
the case where the space is uni-dimensional, modeled as a graph G. In graph convergence, robots have to end up 
on one or two vertices of the same edge. We consider also a variant of robot convergence on graphs, edge covering,
where additionally it is required that not all robots end up on the same vertex. Remarkably, these two similar 
problems have very different computability properties, related to orthogonal fundamental issues of distributed 
computations: agreement and symmetry breaking. We characterize the graphs on which each of these problems is 
solvable, and give optimal time algorithms for the solvable cases. Although the results can be derived from known 
general topology theorems, the presentation serves as a self-contained introduction to the topology approach to 
distributed computing, and yields concrete algorithms and impossibility results.
